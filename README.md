# An LLM-Powered Virtual Assistant for Software Navigation and Explainability in the Oil Industry
This is a repository which contains the supplementary material for the article.
Aside from this README.md, in this repository you'll find the [prompt templates](Prompts.md) used to construct the prompts sent to the generative models.

Additionally, a video demonstrating the virtual assistant's interface inside the software, showing the chat window and action suggestion feature, can be seen below:

## Experimental Setup

Specifics:
 - Ubuntu 24.04.2 LTS
 - NVIDIA RTX A6000 GPU (48GB)
 - CUDA 12.4
 - Python 3.12.3

This work uses the SentenceTransformer class from the SentenceTransformers library [[1]](#1) for loading the chunk and query encoders and CrossEncoder for reranker models.
Database vector retrieval uses FAISS [[2]](#2), which quickly retrieves the $k$-closest items due to algorithms being executed on the GPU.
Lastly, the transformers library [[3]](#3) was used to load the models.
